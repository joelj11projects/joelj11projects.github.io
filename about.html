    <h3>Profile</h3>
        <p>IT is used in all businesses and consistently changing every year. It has the potential to change the world and I would like to be a part of it. The experience from various programming languages and software tools has helped me gain understanding on various software development environment. Being an enthusiastic individual who likes to try new technologies has shown me different sides of software development. A virtual reality app interacting with Microsoft Band was developed as part of my master’s dissertation. Learning the Unity software and C# were needed to complete the project. </p>
    <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>University of Hertfordshire - BSc Information Technology (Entertainment Systems)</p>
        <p>University of Kent - MSc Mobile Application Design</p>
            
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>Outside of work I get involved in a missionary group to help setup events of teenagers and youths. This helps me give something back to the community. Last year carried out a camping event worth £10,000 which was successful. I also like to keep up to date with tech news, so I read The Verge and Wired regularly. </p>
